# hybrid_rosenbrock

A python implementation of ```https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09556```

## Motivation

It is important to have reliable benchmarks to check against in order to quantify the performance, or confirm the validity of, Bayesian inference algorithms. The hybrid Rosenbrock distribution is a benchmark that
1. may be sampled directly,
2. may be extended to an arbitrary dimension $n \ge 1$,
3. may be tuned to increased or decreased difficulty easily,
4. resembles many practical problems of interest (e.g, https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15163).
